# Description
I'm adding some python code, using the "redis" package (I believe it was formally known as "redis-py") to pull messages from redis. There are not many example projects 
and/or example tutorials on this usage (specifically with streams), so I am offering my own example that I plan to use in another project.

# Requirements
1) You will need to have either Redis installed on your local machine (make sure it is version 5.0+) or have access to a Redis server.
2) Install the "redis" package in your Python project (see requirements.txt)
